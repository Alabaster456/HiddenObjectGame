HiddenObjectGame
================

UNCOMPLETE
--
This game is *not* finished! I have plenty more to add, so please don't assume! Here is what I need:

1. A cheat where the player can select any level of their choosing
2. More audio (for each level and etc)
3. A way for the user to quit the game (maybe)
4. More levels
5. More items for the user to find
6. A little storyline, if needed


That's just the beginning!

I will add more to this README later, but if you want to join me - be my guest! Contact me at yazidnoned@hotmail.com
